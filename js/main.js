/*Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids"*/

var numOfChild = 3;
let partnerName = "Trevor";
let geolocation = "Nashville";
let jobTitle = "Software Engineer";

console.log("You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geolocation + ", and married to " + partnerName + " with " + numOfChild + " kids.");
